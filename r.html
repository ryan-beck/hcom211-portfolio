<h1> Class Reflection</h1>
<div id="line">
  <p>HCOM 211 was probably the best writing class I have ever had, in terms of both learning and enjoyment. I learned how to properly make a good outline for  a writing assignment so that I am well prepared for the assignment. Also, I learned a lot about structuring essays properly. Before this class I had never written a paper longer than four or five pages. I now can comfortably write long papers thanks to these learned skills.</p>
  <p>I found the book A Place to Stand to be a good read. The story was very interesting and entertaining. The book also touched on some important subjects, such as discrimination and prison overcrowding. As a class we had some good conversations on these issues and on the book as a whole. I did however find some parts of the book to seem a bit exaggerated, but it was still a good book nonetheless.</p>
  <p>I thought that Project One served as a great introduction to the class. It was a short and straightforward assignment that allowed me to get a good feel for what the class was going to be like. The readings for the project were both interesting and relatively easy. I found the idea of Discourse communities to be very interesting. Understanding how they make a person into who they are and how that influences their thinking is important This understanding allows a person to better perceive why somebody thinks the way they do and recognize any bias that person may have. Learning about Discourse communities also gave me a better understanding of myself and how I have been made into the person I am today. The Discourse communities I have been a part of in the past, whether big or small, have impacted my understanding of the world. The ability to step outside of my own perspective and view my life more objectively has allowed me to experience personal growth.</p>
  <p>Project two, in my opinion was a good way to prepare us for the final research paper. Having this project be presented as simply research made it easy to formulate a solid opinion on my topic and form reasons to back my opinion. When Project Three came along, I had a good idea of what I wanted to do because of Project Two. This project was unlike any writing I have done before, being that it was strictly analysis with no commentary. I had to research opposing sides of an argument and really listen to understand both sides. This helped me better understand how to go about forming an opinion on a topic in a clear and concise way. Also, I found the socratic seminar to be very useful and interesting. It allowed me see the perspectives of others and gain insights that I otherwise would have missed. This intern allowed me to gain a better understanding of my topic and strengthen my opinion. </p>
  <p>Project Three was probably the most beneficial writing assignment I have ever had. After doing the project, I believe that I am now a much better writer. This project taught me how to properly do research on a subject. I learned to write about opinions other people have said and how they are related, as opposed to trying to find quotes that support my already existing opinions. Doing the outline beforehand was extremely helpful. Meeting the minimum page requirements was no challenge, as I was able to refer to the outline for each section of my paper. This project taught me how to analyze sources and to know if they are credible or not. I also liked how we were able to pick our own topics. I find it much easier to write about a subject that I am passionate about or at least find interesting. I think of myself to be a good writer, but when I am assigned something that I do not really care about, my writing tends to suffer.</p>
  <p>My favorite part of the class was probably the second socratic seminar. We had some good discussions and it was interesting to find out what topics people care about. Overall, HCOM 211 was a good class and I am glad to have taken it. I learned a lot and would now consider myself to be a better writer than I was before taking the class.</p>
