<h2>Net Neutrality Documented Argument</h2>
<div id="line">
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Net neutrality is an an issue that has received a lot of attention as of late. In November the FCC announced its long awaited proposal to kill net neutrality. This announcement has re-sparked heated debates between internet users and companies alike. Proponents for net neutrality laws claim that they are necessary to protect consumers and freedom on the internet.  Those against believe that the current regulatory laws are overbearing and harm businesses. Many frequent internet users are currently fighting back against the plan to end net neutrality regulations, but average consumers do not even know what the fight is about. So, what does net neutrality mean anyways?</p>
<p>Net neutrality is the principle that Internet Service Providers (ISPs), such as AT&#38;T or Comcast, cannot speed up or slow down specific content being accessed through their service. Under these principles ISPs cannot choose favorites between content providers (CPs), such as Google or Netflix. Likewise, CPs cannot pay ISPs to speed up their content or slow down their competitors.</p>
<p>Although the idea of net neutrality has been around for some time, it was not until recently that it was signed into law. In 2015, under The Open Internet Order, ISPs were reclassified as common carriers (Getachew). This reclassification subjected them to Title II regulations under section 202 of The Communications Act of 1934, making it unlawful for any ISP to give any “unreasonable preference or advantage” or “unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage” to online content providers (United States 36).</p>
<p>In January of 2017, President Trump appointed Ajit Pai to Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission and in April Pai unveiled a plan to dismantle Net Neutrality laws (Puzzanghera). The FCC quickly received millions of comments from consumers in defense of net neutrality laws.</p>
<p>On November 22, the FCC revealed its final proposal to end net neutrality regulations. The proposal would change the ruling of the Open Internet Order of 2015, meaning ISPs would no longer be classified as common carriers and no longer subject to Title II regulations (Kastrenakes). The FCC will vote on the final decision on December 14. If the proposal is to pass it could mean the end of the open internet as we know it.</p>
<p>As a student studying computer science, I find the issue of net neutrality to be quite personal. In the future I hope to be a software engineer and develop web applications. If people do not have access to a free and open internet it may become very hard for my applications to reach users. My personal reasons are not all that is at stake here, however. Consumers are at risk of losing full access to the omnipresent tool that is the internet. Net Neutrality laws are necessary because without them there would be unfair competition for online content providers, the type and amount of content available on the internet would change drastically, and consumers would be hurt while some content providers and ISPs operate at the same profit margins. </p>
<h3>Unfair Competition</h3>
<p>If net neutrality is done away with, it would mean unfair competition for content providers. Tim Wu, who is largely credited for the idea of net neutrality writes, “A communications network like the Internet can be seen as a platform for a competition among application developers. Email, the web, and streaming applications are in a battle for the attention and interest of end-users. It is therefore important that the platform be neutral to ensure the competition remains meritocratic, ” (Wu 146). It is important that competition remain untampered for content providers to ensure that consumers will get the content that they deem to be the best. Without net neutrality, ISPs could destroy fair competition by choosing which content gets sped up or slowed down, blocking certain content entirely, and by charging fees to content providers that want to be accessed on their network or customers who want to access certain content.</p>
<p>No Title II regulations for ISPs would mean that they would be free to throttle certain content for a multitude of reasons. ISPs would thereby be able to pick and choose favorites between content providers. Free Press, an organization dedicated to protecting net neutrality, defines net neutrality as meaning, “that ISPs should provide us with open networks — and shouldn’t block or discriminate against any applications or content that ride over those networks.” (“Net Neutrality: What You Need”). An open internet means free access to any content available online. If ISPs are able to speed up or slow down certain content it would create unfair competition for content providers. In a discussion of net neutrality Sen. Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts stated, “No one should have to ask permission to innovate, and we need to retain the ability of all Internet users to communicate and compete on a level playing field, preventing the presence of fast and slow lanes that are contrary to the essence of the Internet,” (Kang). He argues here that the internet is a means of communication and that individuals should be able to communicate freely on it without ISPs tampering with the speeds at which said communication happens. Haley Sweetland Edwards of Time Magazine writes that net neutrality, “prevents media conglomerates that own Internet pipes as well as content from using slowdowns to turn the screws on competitors,” (Edwards). Some large conglomerates own ISPs as well as CPs, and they would be able to slow down all of their competitors while prioritizing their own content.</p>
<p>On top of slowing and speeding up or slowing down content, ISPs would be able to block certain content entirely without Title II regulations. If ISPs are able to block specific content, then CPs will begin to have a hard time reaching consumers. Tim Wu writes, “imagine that the nation’s broadband operators came to feel that IP ‘‘chat’’ programs were just a waste of time, and were able to use their control over the last mile to ban their use. Such discrimination has both a direct harm as well as several negative externalities,” (Wu 151). Wu goes on to give an example of this happening in the marketplace by explaining how Comcast denied users from using VPN applications in 2001 (Wu 152). He points out here that without laws protecting CPs and consumers, ISPs would be able to ban content for any reason they deem justifiable. When recently asked about the FCC’s new proposal Wu had stated, “What I'm concerned about is Pai's new rules allow blocking, you know, as long as they disclose of anything. So, you know, Netflix could have been blocked in the cradle. You know, Skype could have been blocked. Even Google could have been slow-laned,” (NPR.org). If ISPs are allowed to block any content they feel necessary, then consumers may miss out on applications that could turn out to be useful.</p>
<p>An alternative to ISPs slowing or blocking content that they do not like is to simply charge more for accessing said content. These prices imposed by ISPs could be passed on to both CPs and consumers. The dictating of pricing by the ISPs alone would create drastically unfair competition for CPs. Amy Nordrum, writer for IEEE Spectrum, writes, “ISPs won’t spend very much money on achieving faster speeds when they could just slow down service for any content producer who doesn’t fork over enough cash,” (Nordrum). No net neutrality would mean a change in the way ISPs make money. They would begin to make a large portion of the profits from fees charged to content providers who are being accessed by consumers on their network. In January, before Ajit Pai was appointed chairman, the FCC stated that the absence of net neutrality laws would, “present significant risks to consumers and competition… because of network operators’ potentially unreasonable discrimination in favor of their own affiliates,” (Hiltzik). Without Title II regulations ISPs would clearly favor the CPs that they are in business with over those in which they are not. To understand what the internet would look like if this was allowed one could look at the situation in Portugal. In Portugal, where these access fees are allowed, customers of the ISP called MEO first pay their subscription fee and then must pay more fees to access different applications (Hiltzik). Each fee only covers a certain “group” of applications and consumers must pay more if they wish to access a wide range of applications.</p>
<p>The internet is a place where companies and individuals can take their ideas directly to the consumer without a middleman. What Pai and the FCC are trying to do is make ISPs the middlemen. They would regulate what content is accessed and at what price. It is of utmost importance to keep Title II regulations in place to protect the spirit of the internet that is fair competition.</p>
<h3>Content Availability</h3>
<p>The absence of Title II regulations would mean that the type and amount of content available on the internet would change drastically. If ISPs are allowed to block or slow certain content, or to charge fees to applications being accessed on their network, the internet would become a quite different place. No net neutrality would result in less innovation in the industry, a harder entry barrier for CPs, and a possible limiting of free speech on the internet; all of which would limit available online content.</p>
<p>As a result of CPs being charged for access there would be less innovation in the industry. Authors Greenstein, Peitz, and Valletti state in their academic paper “Net Neutrality: A Fast Lane to Understanding the Trade-offs” that content providers “argue that the absence of Net Neutrality rules will deter them from innovating” (Greenstein 3). This is due to the fact that a larger portion of their money would be going to the ISPs in the form of access fees instead of their own projects. Nicholas Economides, Economist at New York University, states, “The greatest threat to innovation is if new companies, innovative companies, have to pay a lot to be on the same playing field as everybody else,” (Nordrum). This expands on the previous point that if CPs have to pay large amounts of money, then their performance and innovation will suffer. Economides believes that “preserving net neutrality would promote innovation and economic development across the most businesses,” (Nordrum). Net neutrality allows CPs and ISPs to be on the same playing field while both receiving the profits they deserve. On the other hand, no net neutrality allows ISPs to make a killing while everyone else suffers.</p>
<p>Less innovation runs hand in hand with the fact that killing net neutrality would mean a harder entry barrier for new content producing companies. New companies will not be able to produce content due to the higher expenses. Steve Lohr of The New York Times writes, “higher prices may be prohibitive for start-up companies and new voices in the media and entertainment worlds,” (Lohr). With such high costs being imposed on CPs, it would become very hard for newcomers to join the space. This would be bad news for new startups. The Free Press article titled “Net Neutrality's Impact on Free Speech” states, “Gutting Net Neutrality means that revolutionary Internet ideas, which have historically come from cash-poor outsiders, will die in their infancy,” (“Net Neutrality's Impact”). Many of the most impactful companies that have emerged on the internet started out small and may not have been able to thrive if ISPs had been allowed to dictate access.  Hassan Habibi Gharakheili writes in his book, The Role of SDN in Broadband Networks, writes, “Net neutrality has the potential to protect smaller CPs, who may not have the deep pockets to pay ISPs for prioritization of their content,” (Gharakheili p.7). Without net neutrality smaller or newer content providers would have trouble reaching their users and staying in business. This would create a higher entry barrier for content providers and possibly set up monopoly-like conditions for the giant content providers.</p>
<p>Less innovation and entry barriers are not the only reasons that the amount of content available online is under threat. ISPs could use their power to limit access to sites that support a particular ideology or opinion, thereby limiting free speech on the internet. This is possibly the most important reason to protect net neutrality. Tim Wu, when asked about the FCC’s recent proposal, stated “It takes it into a completely different direction, almost more like the Chinese Internet, where in China, the state decides which sites are allowed to be shown to users or not,” (NPR.org). In the case of the United States we would be giving that power to the ISPs. They would decide what content is readily available and what is not. Minnesota Senator Al Franken believes the issue of net neutrality to be the most important first amendment issue of our time. He writes, “The internet today is an open marketplace. If you have a product, you can sell it. If you have an opinion, you can blog about it. If you have an idea, you can share it with the world,” (Franken). The internet is a place in which anybody on Earth can speak their mind. It has become an important tool of democracy, making it important that everyone have equal access. The Free Press article “Net Neutrality's Impact on Free Speech” states, “Gutting Net Neutrality means regressing toward a shameful era in our history when the ideas and beliefs of the majority were unabashedly valued over those of minorities,” (“Net Neutrality's Impact”). No net neutrality could open the possibility for minority communities having their opinions silenced by ISPs.</p>
<p>If net neutrality is done away with the internet would become a much different place. The endless information and entertainment that it brings would begin to diminish. The internet is a place in which anyone has the ability to get their message out. Itt gives democracy the chance to thrive and gives every individual the chance to participate. This participation, however, is only possible under the protection of net neutrality. Without it we would lose so many of the freedoms and opportunities that we currently take for granted.</p>
<h3>Effect on Consumers</h3>
<p>If Title II regulations are done away with, consumers will be put at a huge disadvantage. On top of losing the opportunities and the freedoms that the internet brings, consumers would likely have to pay more for the same products. The removal of Title II regulations would mean consumers having to pay more for the internet, leave consumers open to discrimination and inequality, and all the while some CPs and ISPs would operate at the same profit margins.</p>
<p>No net neutrality means an expensive internet. Today we take the readily available and cheap access to the internet for granted. The FCC’s proposal presents the possibility of this all changing. Celia Kang of the Washington Post gives this scenario: “a company that offers broadband could also repackage Internet service plans to offer premium access at a higher cost to certain Web sites like Hulu, CNN.com or Pandora,” (Kang).  This means that consumers could be charged access fees if they wish to use certain applications. If they choose not to pay the fees they may be blocked from using the applications or suffer from dramatically slower connection. Steve Lohr of The New York Times writes, “If the big internet and media companies will have to pay their carriers more for high-speed services, the expenses will trickle down to households,” (Lohr). Even if consumers are not charged directly by ISPs for access, CPs would likely pass on their access fees to users. This presents the possibility of applications that are currently free becoming paid services. Consumers have much to lose if the repeal of net neutrality regulations is to go through.</p>
<p>Not only would consumers have to pay more without Title II regulations but they would also be open to discrimination and inequality. As mentioned before, the internet has become an important tool in everyday life and restricted access would greatly harm individuals. Steve Lohr of The New York Times, writes of “the essential role of high-speed internet access as a gateway to modern communication, information, entertainment and economic opportunity,” (Lohr). It is important that this “gateway” remains open to all individuals. If the internet becomes accessible to only those who can  afford it, then a large portion of people would be put at a disadvantage. These people would not have access to the information and opportunity that the internet brings. The internet plays a huge role in modern day life and it would be unjust to limit the ability for individuals to use it. Lohr also writes that without net neutrality the internet would become a “technology with two tiers: one that has speedy service and one that doesn’t. The high-speed lane would be occupied by big internet and media companies, and affluent households. For everyone else there would be the slow lane,” (Lohr). Without net neutrality a likely scenario would be that average consumers would not have reliable internet access. Fast internet would become a luxury for only the rich. The repeal of net neutrality could very well lead to greater economic and social inequality.</p>
<p>While consumers would be hurt by the removal of Title II regulations, ISPs and content providers would likely operate at the same profit margins. Consumers would have to pay more for the same product at no cost to the ISPs and content providers. Authors Greenstein, Peitz, and Valletti in their academic paper “Net Neutrality: A Fast Lane to Understanding the Trade-offs” state, “Because broadband and content are perfect complements, the demand for both depends on the total price that an end user will have to pay.”  They continue with,  “The two firms are free to set whatever price or subscription fee that they want to final users.” (Greenstein 10). They elaborate on this by explaining that if ISPs charge content providers for being accessed on their network then the increased prices are passed on to consumers. Customers are forced to pay more or no longer subscribe. ISPs and CPs operate at the same profit margins just with less customers and higher prices. It can be imagined how this could lead to a very bad scenario for consumers in the future as the internet becomes unaffordable for many. Greenstein, Peitz, and Valletti also write, “The Federal Communications Commission found that a limited percentage of US households had access to a provider of broadband at 25 Mbps or more, and 20 percent had no access. Thus, an internet service provider (ISP) may enjoy a strong position in contractual negotiations with content providers, as it provides exclusive access to consumers who seek high-bandwidth services” (Greenstein 6). This quote shows that many consumers have limited internet options and could not simply switch to a new provider if they were not happy with their current. This means that without Title II regulations ISPs could charge whatever fees they wanted and consumers would have no choice but to pay or go without access.</p>
<p>If the FCC is allowed to continue with the rollback of Title II regulations consumers would be hurt greatly. The internet would become more expensive to use, consumers would face the possibility of social and economic inequality and ISPs would hardly be affected. Many ISPs would continue to operate at the same profit margins while consumers would be hurt. All of the information and opportunity that the internet brings individuals is at risk of being lost. The upcoming vote has the potential to destroy all of the personal freedoms that the internet brings.</p>
<h3>Counterarguments</h3>
<p>Consumers who are informed on the concept of net neutrality are typically in support of it. Those against it are generally the ISPs, who have much to gain from its removal, and also groups of right-leaning individuals and politicians who favor small government and deregulation. The opposing groups of net neutrality argue that Title II regulations are unjustified and have hurt investment in the broadband industry.</p>
<p>Adversaries of net neutrality argue that the imposing of Title II regulations on ISPs under the Open Internet Order was unwarranted. They claim that there is not enough evidence of  ISPs going against the principles of net neutrality to justify the regulation. Ajit Pai, who has become the figurehead for the campaign against net neutrality,  argues this in an April 2017 interview with PBS Newshour. He states, “There are isolated cases [of ISPs blocking or throttling specific applications], but if you look at the FCC’s own record, there are only scattered anecdotes,” (Pai). He claims here that the throttling or blocking of specific content is very rare in the marketplace. Pai goes on to say, “In order to justify preemptive regulation of all 4,462 internet service providers you should have pretty concrete evidence of an overwhelming market failure,” (Pai). Pai says that there are far too many companies to subject to Title II regulations for the wrongdoings of just a few. In a July statement, AT&T expressed that they “continue to support [open internet requirements], and we continue to oppose Title II as an unprecedented regulatory overreach for which there was no economic or marketplace justification,” (Breland). AT&T, along with other ISPs state that they are not opposed to an open internet, only the needless regulations put in place by Title II.</p>
<p>One of the more common arguments against net neutrality is that it has hurt investment in the broadband sector and this lack of funding has proven to be bad news for companies and consumers alike. In a July statement on Title II regulations, Comcast stated, “Such regulation is entirely unnecessary and imposes substantial costs that undermine investment and innovation in the broadband ecosystem and undercut efforts to bridge the digital divide in this country,”  (Breland). They argue here that since net neutrality laws have been in place ISPs have faced higher business costs and less investment. They say these conditions combined have resulted in less innovation in the industry, which is bad for both the companies and consumers. Ajit Pai would agree with this. He states, “Among the top 12 internet service providers, investment is down by 5.6 percent, or several billion dollars over the last two years,” (Pai). If these statistics are to be believed it would seem in the two years since net neutrality laws have been in place that ISPs have suffered great losses. Pai expands on this by arguing that with this lack of investment, “We could end up disincentivizing companies from wanting to build out internet access to a lot of parts of the country; low income, urban, and rural areas, for example,” (Pai). He states here that the lack of investment could lead to a scenario in which many Americans end up with slow internet, or possibly none at all.</p>
<p>The two strongest arguments against Title II regulations are that they are uncalled for and have hurt investment in the broadband industry. These claims however, are not entirely true. For example, Peter Svensson of The Associated Press reported in 2007, “Comcast Corp. actively interferes with attempts by some of its highspeed Internet subscribers to share files online, a move that runs counter to the tradition of treating all types of Net traffic equally,” (Svensson).  This clearly proves the claim that before the Open Internet Order there was no favoring of content by ISPs to be false. This is no isolated incident, either. Devin Coldewey of Techcrunch, reports of multiple occurrences of this happening, including AT&#38;T in 2011 and Comcast yet again in 2016 (Coldewey). ISPs simply cannot be trusted with the power to slow or block content. Historically they have proven to not do the right thing. Coldeway also argues that there is not conclusive data to claim that net neutrality laws have, in fact, hurt investment in the industry. He also references a report by Free Press that argues quite the opposite. The  report states, “ All [internet related companies] are humming along nicely more than two years after the Federal Communications Commission voted to adopt Net Neutrality rules and reclassify broadband internet access as a Title II telecommunications service. Investments, capacities, revenues and subscribership are all at historic highs and are poised to continue this meteoric rise,” (Turner). The report gives extensive data to show that ISPs and CPs alike have continued to thrive under net neutrality regulations, proving them to not be the hindrance that they have been accused of being.</p>
<p>Many of the arguments against net neutrality may sound logical on the surface but when investigated further, they begin to fall apart. Title II regulations are justified as proven by the actions of ISPs in the era before net neutrality and they are not burdensome on ISPs as many of them claim. The ISPs are not hurt by net neutrality, they are still making a killing. The reasoning behind their opposition of net neutrality is simply the prospect of making more money than they already do, and at great a cost to consumers.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>We live in an age in which people have more freedom of information and opportunity than any time in human history.. The internet has evolved into an important aspect of society at large. It is necessary to keep it free and open to all individuals to ensure social and economic equality for all. If net neutrality laws are done away with we will lose so much of what we often take for granted. We would lose fair competition, which is itself the backbone of innovation on the internet and as a result would end up with far less content available. We would also encounter the possibilities of free speech being limited and discrimination of certain minority communities. Net neutrality is possibly one of the more important issues of the past few years and it is important that individuals stay informed and voice their opinions.</p>
