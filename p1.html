<h2> CS++ Discourse Community</h2>
<div id="line">
<p>
  James Paul Gee, Department of Linguistics at University of Southern California and author of “Literacy Discourse, and Linguistics”, defines a discourses as “ways of being in the world; they are the forms of life which integrate words, acts, values, beliefs, attitudes, and social identities as well as gestures, glances, body positions and clothes,” (Gee 5).  Discourses are groups that one associates them self with.  They have unique rules and ways of interacting within the group.  A discourse  community that I am a part of is the CS++ cohort at CSUMB.  We are a group of Computer Science students who all take the same classes and provide a support group for one another.  John Swales, linguist at the University of Michigan, furthers the idea of discourses by defining six characteristics of these communities.  The characteristics are shared goals of the community, mechanisms of communication, participatory mechanisms to provide information and feedback, genres in the communicative furtherance of its aims, special words or language unique to the group, and threshold levels of membership (Swales 470-473).  These six characteristics are set discourse communities apart from one another.  The CS++ cohort is a unique group with our own specific characteristics that we are all defined by in one way or another.
</p>
<p>	As a cohort we have a shared set of goals that we pursue.  First and foremost is passing classes.  We provide a support system for help with homework and projects.  We have the same classes making an ideal study group as we are all able to help each other with any work we may have.  Success in school as well as in careers is important to the cohort.  Another goal of ours is to learn to code and understand the material we are learning in order to be able to apply these skills in the industry after graduation.  We provide each other with opportunities for growth that we would otherwise not have outside of the cohort.</p>
<p>	The cohort has different mechanisms of communication that we use for different purposes.  We communicate in person during our classes and study hours, as well as our Friday Cohort Enrichment.  During these times we discuss mostly classwork but also some extracurricular programming material and industry related news.  We also communicate on Slack channels.  Slack gives us a semi-formal way to communicate with not just the cohort but also the broader Computer Science community at CSUMB and our professors.  Finally, we communicate on a more personal and informal level using our group message on Snapchat.  This gives us a space to get to know each other and mess around.</p>
<p>	We also have specific mechanisms of participation. These include attending classes and group meetings.  We expect one another to show up to we what are obliged to.  Another form of participation in the group is helping with projects and assignments.  We are open to helping anyone in the group and in return we all feel comfortable asking for help because we know that everyone in the group is more than willing.  A third participation mechanism is something that we call going above and beyond.  Going above and beyond is doing more than what our classes ask in order to get the most of our education.  We all expect one another to not just go to class, do the work, and get the grade.  The cohort strives to do more than just that.  We try to actually apply what he have learned to our own projects.</p>
<p>	The cohort has a few genres that we use in particular situations.  We can be very nerdy and we have a similar sense of humor, so we joke around quite a lot.  This allows us to form good relationships and creates an ideal support community for one another.  We can also be very serious at times when work needs to be done.  When coding or working on other schoolwork we can be very intensive in our work.  We focus when we need to, allowing us to pass our classes and learn what we need to be successful in our careers.  </p>
<p>	On top of the genres we use, we also use special words and language unique to our group.  We have a lot of inside jokes and memes that outsiders might find weird or not understand.  We also have many conversations about technical things regarding computer science, in which outsiders would be lost.  Also, we use a lot of acronyms not only within the cohort but at CSUMB as a whole.  People who are not students at CSUMB would have no idea what any of them mean.</p>
<p>	There are some threshold levels of membership that define whether a not a person can be a part of the cohort.  The first is to be a computer science student at CSUMB and to have met the requirements needed to join.  Another is to attend classes and meetings.  If someone misses a class or meeting they will have missed some valuable information and would be unable to fully contribute to the community.  The third threshold is to keep up good grades.  We can hold each other accountable this way to make sure we stay on task.</p>
