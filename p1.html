<h2> CS++ Discourse Community</h2>
<h3> Description of CS++ Discourse Community</h3>
<div id="line">
<p>James Paul Gee, Department of Linguistics at University of Southern California and author of “Literacy Discourse, and Linguistics”, defines a discourses as “ways of being in the world; they are the forms of life which integrate words, acts, values, beliefs, attitudes, and social identities as well as gestures, glances, body positions and clothes,” (Gee 5).  Discourses are groups that one associates them self with. They have unique rules and ways of interacting within the group. A discourse community that I am a part of is the CS++ cohort at CSUMB. We are a group of Computer Science students who all take the same classes and provide a support group for one another. The CS++ cohort is a unique group with our own specific characteristics that we are all defined by in one way or another. John Swales, linguist at the University of Michigan, furthers the idea of discourses by defining six characteristics of these communities. The characteristics are shared goals of the community, mechanisms of communication, participatory mechanisms to provide information and feedback, genres in the communicative furtherance of its aims, special words or language unique to the group, and threshold levels of membership (Swales 470-473). These six characteristics are what set discourse communities apart from one another. I will be using Swales’ characteristics to define what sets the CS++ discourse community apart from others. </p>
<p>As a cohort we have a shared set of goals that we pursue. First and foremost is passing classes. We provide a support system for help with homework and projects. We have the same classes making an ideal study group as we are all able to help each other with any work we may have. Success in school as well as in careers is important to the cohort. Another goal of ours is to learn to code and understand the material we are learning in order to be able to apply these skills in the industry after graduation. We provide each other with opportunities for growth that we would otherwise not have outside of the cohort.</p>
<p>The cohort has different mechanisms of communication that we use for different purposes. We communicate in person during our classes and study hours, as well as our Friday Cohort Enrichment. During these times we discuss mostly classwork but also some extracurricular programming material and industry related news. We also communicate on Slack channels. Slack gives us a semi-formal way to communicate with not just the cohort but also the broader Computer Science community at CSUMB and our professors. Finally, we communicate on a more personal and informal level using our group message on Snapchat. This gives us a space to get to know each other and have fun.</p>
<p>We also have specific mechanisms of participation. These include attending classes and group meetings. We expect one another to show up to we what are obliged to. Another form of participation in the group is helping with projects and assignments.  We are open to helping anyone in the group and in return we all feel comfortable asking for help because we know that everyone in the group is more than willing. A third participation mechanism is something that we call going above and beyond. Going above and beyond is doing more than what our classes ask in order to get the most of our education. We all expect one another to not just go to class, do the work, and get the grade. The cohort strives to do more than just that. We try to actually apply what he have learned in order to grow as individuals.</p>
<p>The cohort has a few genres that we use in particular situations. We can be very nerdy and we have a similar sense of humor, so we joke around quite a lot. This allows us to form good relationships and creates an ideal support community for one another. We can also be very serious at times when work needs to be done. When coding or working on other schoolwork we can be very intensive in our work. We focus when we need to, allowing us to pass our classes and learn what we need to be successful in our careers. </p>
<p>On top of the genres we use, we also use special words and language unique to our group. We have a lot of inside jokes and memes that outsiders might find weird or not understand. We also have many conversations about technical things regarding computer science, in which outsiders would be lost. Also, we use a lot of acronyms not only within the cohort but at CSUMB as a whole. People who are not students at CSUMB would not understand what they mean.</p>
<p>There are some threshold levels of membership that define whether or not a person can be a part of the cohort. The first is to be a computer science student at CSUMB and to have met the requirements needed to join. Another is to attend classes and meetings. If someone misses a class or meeting they will have missed some valuable information and would be unable to fully contribute to the community. The third threshold is to keep up good grades. We can hold each other accountable this way to make sure we stay on task.</p>
<h3> Analysis of CS++ Discourse Community</h3>
<p>The CS++ discourse community is still new to me as we have only known each other for a couple of months. However, in those months it has made a big impact on me. Without the cohort, school would likely be a lot different for me.  The  work that the cohort produces and the common topics of discussion that keep our discourse community together have provided me a space to fit in at CSUMB and have kept me on track, putting me ahead of most other freshman computer science students.</p>
<p>Some discourses produce written documents or other work that sets the group apart from others. For example, to be an author one must publish a book, and to be a poet one must publish a poem. The CS++ cohort and the broader Computer Science community work in this way as well. In order to be a computer scientist one must publish code. We make programs and applications and these are what defines us as members of the discourse. The code I have produced has excited me to learn more and expand my knowledge in computer science.</p>
<p>The common topics of discussion in the cohort are often related to technology or school, and new knowledge for the group typically resides in one of these two categories. We are all generally excited to talk and learn about technology. Belonging to a community that is just as interested in computer science as I am has allowed me flourish in this topic.  Having people to discuss computer science with lets me understand it on a deeper level.  When coding for a school assignment I do not necessarily view it as a typical homework assignment.  I genuinely enjoy coding thanks to the community expanding my interest in computer science. We encourage one another to pursue interests in programming, no matter how challenging they may seem.  When trying to understand a new concept we often work together to figure it out. This is done through both discussion and practice. We work through problems by discussing possible solutions and actually testing out our ideas in code. Aside from just computer science, we can also apply our learning strategies to other subjects, providing a great community for success.</p>
<p>The cohort is different than my past discourse communities in some ways, but overall it is pretty similar and I have been able to adapt and fit in well. Computer science students are typically more nerdy than others and the cohort is no exception. Adapting to it was not too hard considering I have always had a somewhat nerdy friend group. Most of us in the cohort also have pretty similar senses of humor so we were able to get along well from the beginning. From just the first couple weeks of knowing the members of the cohort I knew that it would be a good fit for me. I now have a group at CSUMB that I know I belong to.</p>
<p>The cohort has started me off on a good foot in the pursuit of my bachelor’s in Computer Science. Thanks to the cohort I have had experience that other computer science students have not. For example, about a month before school started the cohort participated in what is called Google’s Computer Science Summer Institute Extension (CSSI-x). This was a three week course to give us a head start in computer science. We worked with a lot of different tools and programming languages in a short amount of time. CSSI-x really expanded my interest in computer science and excited me to get the year started.  I learned a lot in those three weeks and I now feel that I am in a better position than I would be without CS++. On top of this, the cohort keeps me on track of my schoolwork. Being that everyone in the cohort has the same classes I can never forget when anything is due. We are all there to remind each other when something is due. </p>
<p>CS++ is a group of like-minded individuals in which I have been able to strive. It has provided me many benefits and will continue to do so for the rest of my education and career. These benefits can be personal and also related to my education or career.  Although I have only been a part of this community for a short time, I believe that it will be one of the most impactful discourses that I will ever be a part of.</p>
