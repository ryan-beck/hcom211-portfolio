<h2>Net Neutrality Literature Review</h2>
<div id="line">
<h3> The Issue of Net Neutrality</h3>
<p>Network neutrality is the idea that internet service providers (ISPs), such as AT&#38;T or Comcast,  cannot speed up or slow down certain content. Under the principles of Net Neutrality ISPs cannot pick favorites, and likewise, content providers cannot pay ISPs to load their content faster (Free Press). </p>
<p>The idea of Net Neutrality is largely credited to Tim Wu. In 2003 Wu, then Associate Professor of Law at University of Virginia, wrote a paper called “Network Neutrality, Broadband Discrimination.” In his paper, Wu laid out the basic principles of Net Neutrality, open access, and broadband discrimination. Since the time of his writing, many have followed suit and gotten on board with Net Neutrality, including large internet companies such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon.</p>
<p>It was not until 2015 that Net Neutrality was signed into law. Under the Open Internet Order of 2015 ISPs were reclassified as common carriers (Getachew). This subjected them to Title II regulations under section 202 of The Communications Act of 1934, making it unlawful for any ISP to give any “unreasonable preference or advantage” or “unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage” to online content providers (United States 36). Internet service providers have been subject to these laws ever since.</p>
<p>In January of 2017, President Trump appointed Ajit Pai to Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission and in April Pai unveiled a plan to dismantle Net Neutrality laws (Puzzanghera). Shortly after Pai’s announcement, the FCC received over 22 million comments on their website in defense of Net Neutrality. A vote from the FCC on the final decision is expected later this year.</p>
<h3> Arguments Against Net Neutrality</h3>
<p>According to the FCC’s online biography on Ajit Pai, he is a free market republican who believes in minimal regulation. He claims that regulations of ISPs have actually hurt consumers. The article states his opinion as, “Consumers benefit most from competition, not preemptive regulation. Free markets have delivered more value to American consumers than highly regulated ones,” (Federal Communications Commission). He claims that under stricter regulation ISPs cannot deliver the best value to the consumer. His philosophy is that less regulation of these companies will result in “more innovation, more investment, better products and services, lower prices, more job creation, and faster economic growth” (Federal Communications Commission).</p>
<p>In an April 2017 interview with PBS Newshour Pai explains why he thinks that Net Neutrality is bad for companies and consumers. In the interview he states that he is in favor of an open and free internet, just opposed to the current Title II regulations that are in place (Pai). He goes on to state that under Title II regulations, “We could end up disincentivizing companies from wanting to build out internet access to a lot of parts of the country; low income, urban, and rural areas, for example,” (Pai). He also claims, “There a study by a highly respected economist that says among the top 12 internet service providers, investment is down by 5.6 percent, or several billion dollars over the last two years,” (Pai). As the Open Internet Order was enacted in 2015, he claims that the laws that have been in place since then have damaged investment in the industry. He goes on to state that there has not been enough evidence of internet service providers slowing down or speeding up certain content to justify regulating the entire industry (Pai).</p>
<p>Ali Breland of The Hill reports on statements by the broadband service industry in regards to Net Neutrality in her article “Broadband Companies Make Closing Arguments Against Net Neutrality.”  She reports that on July 17, 2017 companies such as Comcast and AT&#38;T as well as trade associations representing the telecommunications industry filed statements in support of Pai’s proposal to roll back Net Neutrality regulations (Breland). Breland quotes Comcast in saying, “Such regulation is entirely unnecessary and imposes substantial costs that undermine investment and innovation in the broadband ecosystem and undercut efforts to bridge the digital divide in this country.” This supports both Pai’s argument that investment has been hurt as well as his argument that it has become harder for internet service providers to expand to parts of the country that have historically had bad service options. She also quotes AT&#38;T in saying, “We continue to support [open internet requirements], and we continue to oppose Title II as an unprecedented regulatory overreach for which there was no economic or marketplace justification.” (Breland). This statement supports Pai’s argument that regulation of the entire industry is not justified.</p>
<h3> Argument for Net Neutrality</h3>
<p>As stated in the introduction the principles of Net Neutrality can be credited to Tim Wu in his paper “Network Neutrality, Broadband Discrimination”. In the paper, Wu states, “A communications network like the Internet can be seen as a platform for a competition among application developers. Email, the web, and streaming applications are in a battle for the attention and interest of end-users. It is therefore important that the platform be neutral to ensure the competition remains meritocratic, ” (Wu 146). He is arguing that it is important for internet service providers to remain neutral so that content providers have fair competition. He explains that, without Net Neutrality, if an internet service provider does not like a certain application they would be able to block that application from being accessed, harming the consumers who would benefit from using that application (Wu 151).  Wu then goes on to show evidence of this happening in the marketplace by giving an example of Comcast denying a customer usage of a Virtual Private Network application unless they were willing to pay a premium (Wu 152).</p>
<p>In the article “Net Neutrality: A Fast Lane to Understanding the Trade-offs.”, authors Shane Greenstein, Martin Peitz, and Tommaso Valletti write of the economic factors at work in the discussion of Net Neutrality. The article states, “Many content providers argue that without Net Neutrality rules, they will have a harder time reaching end users, reducing the benefits that end users receive from their internet connection. They also argue that the absence of Net Neutrality rules will deter them from innovating” (Greenstein 3). Here they state that content providers claim that without Net Neutrality consumers will have fewer products to choose from and there will be less innovation in the industry. The article goes on to say, “ the Federal Communications Commission found that a limited percentage of US households had access to a provider of broadband at 25 Mbps or more, and 20 percent had no access (Singleton 2015). Thus, an internet service provider (ISP) may enjoy a strong position in contractual negotiations with content providers, as it provides exclusive access to consumers who seek high-bandwidth services” (Greenstein 6). This quote is used to argue that having no Net Neutrality may open doors for discrimination in the marketplace. The article goes on to explain that if ISPs are allowed to charge fees to content providers being accessed on their network, it will only hurt the consumers. Content providers would just raise their prices. This would mean that usage becomes more expensive for the consumer, while both ISPs and content providers operate at the same profit margins (Greenstein 10).</p>
<p>Devin Coldewey of Techcrunch, in his article “These are the arguments against Net Neutrality — and why they’re wrong”, rebuts against common arguments against Net Neutrality. One argument is that the Title II regulations are not justified and that the internet was fine before the laws passed in 2015. He responds to this by citing multiple examples of ISPs going against the principles of Net Neutrality (Coldewey). Another common argument is that the new laws have hurt investment in the sector. He responds to this by explaining that because the open internet laws have only been in place since 2015, there is really not enough data yet to back up this claim (Coldewey). A third argument he responds to is that these regulations have hurt small businesses. He states that the companies claiming this have not produced any numbers regarding costs before the laws versus costs after the laws, rendering this argument invalid (Coldewey).</p>
<h3> Conclusion</h3>
<p>In summary, those who favor Net Neutrality laws believe them to be necessary to protect consumers and freedom on the internet. They believe that without Title II regulations protecting Net Neutrality, ISPs would be too powerful and be able to block certain content from their users.  Those against believe that Title II regulations are harmful to business and unnecessary to keep the internet free and open. They say that the regulations are not justified and overbearing. For many, Net Neutrality may seem to be a boring subject but that does not make it any less important. As most people in the U.S. use the internet on a daily basis, the issue of Net Neutrality is a very relevant issue. The verdict of the coming FCC vote many seal the fate of the internet in the future, for better or for worse. </p>

<div id="line">
  <p>Project two, in my opinion was a good way to prepare us for the final research paper. Having this project be presented as simply research made it easy to formulate a solid opinion on my topic and form reasons to back my opinion. When Project Three came along, I had a good idea of what I wanted to do because of Project Two. This project was unlike any writing I have done before, being that it was strictly analysis with no commentary. I had to research opposing sides of an argument and really listen to understand both sides. This helped me better understand how to go about forming an opinion on a topic in a clear and concise way. Also, I found the socratic seminar to be very useful and interesting. It allowed me see the perspectives of others and gain insights that I otherwise would have missed. This intern allowed me to gain a better understanding of my topic and strengthen my opinion. </p>
